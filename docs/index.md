# *svcs*: A Lightweight Service Locator

Release **{sub-ref}`release`**  ([What's new?](changelog))

::: {admonition} ☠️ Not ready yet! ☠️
:class: danger

This project is only public to [gather feedback](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/discussions), and everything can and will change until the project is proclaimed stable.

While the code has 100% test and type coverage, and the [**Flask** integration](flask) has been in production for years, the API details can still change.

At this point, it's unclear whether this project will become a "proper Hynek project".
I will keep using it for my work projects, but whether this will grow beyond my personal needs depends on community interest.
